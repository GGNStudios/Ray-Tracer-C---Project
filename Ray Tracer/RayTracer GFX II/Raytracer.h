* This is the header file for a "Toy" ray tracer.  This ray tracer is very *
* minimal, and is intended simply for learning the basics of ray tracing.  *
* Here is a partial list of things that are missing from this program that *
* a serious ray tracer would have:                                         *
*                                                                          *
* 1) A method of reading in the geometry of a scene from a file.           *
*                                                                          *
* 2) At least one technique for speeding up ray-object intersection when   *
*    there are a large number of object (e.g. thousands).  In contrast,    *
*    this toy ray tracer uses "brute force" or "naive" ray intersection.   *
*    That is, it simply tests all objects and keeps the closest hit.       *
*                                                                          *
* 3) Some method of anti-aliasing; that is, a method for removing the      *
*    jagged edges, probably by casting multiple rays per pixel.            *
*                                                                          *
*                                                                          *
